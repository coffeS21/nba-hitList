you need to be able to preform the following crud request

GET - get all the nba players and display them

-create an empty array with use state
-this array will hold the players after the get request is made
-this array will be mapped over to display the results

DELETE - remove a player from the array and show the user a message that the player has been removed

POST - add new players to the array of players


PUT - edit a players info and submit it to show the new info
